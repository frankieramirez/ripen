# Mend

Finish the merge, rebase, cherry-pick, or revert that is already in progress. Read both sides of every conflict, keep both intents where they fit, and complete the git operation. Never abort.

## Operating principles

- **Already in progress.** This skill finishes a conflicted operation. It does not start one. If there is no merge state, stop.
- **Always resolve. Never abort.** `git merge --abort`, `git rebase --abort`, `git cherry-pick --abort`, and `git revert --abort` are out.
- **Both intents stay.** A hunk is two changes talking. Keep both when they commute. When they cannot, keep the change that matches the operation's goal and record the trade-off.
- **Invent nothing.** The resolved file contains only behavior that already lived on one side or both. No new feature, no drive-by cleanup.
- **Ours and theirs follow the operation.** On a rebase, HEAD is the branch you are rebasing onto. The script names both sides. Trust it over memory.

## Execution spine

1. Read the operation (Stage 1).
2. Learn why each side changed (Stage 2).
3. Spawn Weaver on the conflicted files (Stage 3).
4. Audit, then run the project's checks (Stage 4).
5. Finish the operation (Stage 5).

---

## Stage 1: State

`SKILL_DIR` is the absolute directory this SKILL.md lives in. The Bash tool forgets variables between calls, so every block that runs the bundled script sets `SKILL_DIR` again on its first line.

```bash
SKILL_DIR="<absolute path of the directory containing this SKILL.md>";
bash "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/conflict-state"
```

The script prints:

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `operation` | `merge`, `rebase`, `cherry-pick`, `revert`, `am`, `unmerged`, or empty |
| `phase` | `conflicts`, `continue`, or `clear` |
| `head` | Current `HEAD` |
| `ours` | The ref the index calls ours |
| `theirs` | The ref the index calls theirs |
| `onto` | Rebase onto-commit, when there is one |
| `goal` | Subject of the operation (merge message, or the commit being replayed) |
| `files` | Unmerged paths as `path<TAB>kind`, one per line after the field |

`phase=clear` (or empty `operation`): stop. There is nothing to mend.

`phase=continue` and an empty `files` list: the markers are gone and the operation still needs a commit or `--continue`. Jump to Stage 4, then Stage 5.

Read `git status` as a second look. Do not start a merge or rebase to create work.

---

## Stage 2: Sources

Load `references/sources.md`. For each conflicted file, recover the reason each side changed: the commits that touched the hunk, their messages, and the PR or issue those commits belong to when `gh` can see them.

Write a short brief before anyone edits a file:

```
Operation: <merge | rebase | ...>  Goal: <one line>
Ours (<ref>): <intent>
Theirs (<ref>): <intent>
```

Do not spawn Weaver until that brief exists.

---

## Stage 3: Weave

Read `references/weaver.md` from this skill's directory. Spawn one subagent with that file's full content as its instructions and the Stage 2 brief plus the file list appended. In Claude Code, prefer the installed agent named `weaver` (or `mana:weaver` when installed as a plugin) if it exists; otherwise, or on any other platform, spawn a generic subagent seeded with the reference file. Do not restate or soften its rules in the prompt.

When many files conflict and they do not share imports or types, split the file list across concurrent Weavers. Two Weavers never edit the same file.

---

## Stage 4: Audit and check

Before trusting the tree:

- Every conflict marker (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`) is gone.
- Weaver edited only unmerged paths. Revert anything else.
- Generated lockfiles were not hand-merged. One side was kept and the lockfile is flagged `REGENERATE`.
- Delete/modify conflicts match the brief: a delete that was the point of that side stays a delete.
- Each trade-off Weaver recorded is real (the two intents could not both live).

A bad report (markers left, scope escaped, invented behavior): restore the conflicted files with `git checkout -m -- <file>`, spawn Weaver once more with the failures named, and audit again. A second failure ends the run: report it and stop. Leave the operation in progress.

For each `REGENERATE` file, run the project's install or lockfile command (`npm install`, `pnpm install`, `cargo generate-lockfile`, and so on) so the lockfile matches the merged manifest. Do this before the checks.

Then load `references/checks.md` and run what the project already has. Fix anything the merge broke. Fixes stay inside the conflicted files and their direct fallout (a test that failed because the merge dropped an import). New behavior is still out.

---

## Stage 5: Finish

Stage the resolved files. Then complete the operation:

| Operation | Command |
|-----------|---------|
| merge | `git commit --no-edit` (reuses `MERGE_MSG`) |
| rebase | `GIT_EDITOR=true git rebase --continue`, then repeat from Stage 1 if the next commit conflicts |
| cherry-pick | `GIT_EDITOR=true git cherry-pick --continue`, then repeat from Stage 1 if more commits remain |
| revert | `GIT_EDITOR=true git revert --continue` |
| am | `GIT_EDITOR=true git am --continue` |
| unmerged | Stage the files. Do not commit. There is no operation message to reuse. |

A rebase or cherry-pick of several commits is a loop: resolve, continue, and if the next commit conflicts, go back to Stage 1. Do not stop after the first commit unless the sequence is done.

Never `--skip` a commit unless it is empty after resolution (the change already landed) and `git rebase --continue` refuses it. Record each skip.

Do not push. The caller pushes.

## Report

```
Mend: <operation>  Goal: <one line>
Resolved: <n> files
Continues: <n>  Skips: <n>

Trade-offs
- <file>: <what was dropped, and why>

Checks: <one line>
Commit: <sha or rebase HEAD>
Open: <anything left conflicted, or none>
```

## References

| Reference | Load at | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| `references/sources.md` | Stage 2 | Recover intent from git and GitHub |
| `references/weaver.md` | Stage 3 | The agent that resolves hunks |
| `references/checks.md` | Stage 4 | Find and run the project's checks |
